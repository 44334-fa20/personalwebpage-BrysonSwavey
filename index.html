        Hi there, welcome to my getting-back-into-the-swing-of-things webpage! This is a good exercise for me <br>to get back into coding HTML and CSS, and help re-motivate myself for the semester at large.<br> I will be breaking down this page into 2 columns; a SUMMER column and a SCHOOL column.<br>This is the best way for me to showcase what happened between each, what's the plan going forward compared to summer, etc.
